## This repo is a random dump of powershells I've written or use frequently / have been modified by me for personal use or at work.

- Hyper-V VM spin ups (SPINUP HYPER-V FOLDER) (You can and should use Vagrant however I have a specific use case where this is quicker to be done manually for work due to strange quirks in a c++ application)
- VMWARE (Need to go through and strip any sensitive data from them before pushing)
- GUI Automation scripts (Need to go through and strip any sensitive data from them before pushing)
- Auto Docker Configs (Need to go through and strip any sensitive data from them before pushing)
